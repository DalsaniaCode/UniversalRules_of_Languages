    <h1 class="first_h1">Universal Rules of Languages</h1>
    <p>
      All languages has different types of write words. This types of writting are:<br>
      Alphabetic; Each thing is named in a sequence of characters who each character is pronounced 1 by 1, it means, one consonant for one character, and one vocal for one character. <br>
      Syllabic; Each thing is named in a sequence of characters who each character is pronounced a syllable. one consonant and a vocal (In this order: C + V) for one character <br>
      and Lolographic; Each thing is named and symbolized by a unique character. This one is harder because is one thing, meaning or object for one symbol, or even can be 2 or 3 for
      make the meaning more formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of an alphabetic scripture is the Latin, Cyrillic and the Greek. For the syllabic scripture is the Devanagari (Bharat scripture), Japanese and the majority of southeast
      asian languages, and for the lolographc scripture are the CJK Ideographic; this 3 are: Chinese characters, Kanji Japanese characters and the Hanga Korean characters (actually
      unused).
    </p>
    <p>
      All languages has different words for name a thing. Not all times a language cannot name a thing by the same way. Groups of languages who names a thing and those results looks
      similar, are called, Family languages. A easy example of a family language is the Romance or Latin languages: [Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French and Italian].
    </p>
    <p>
      Languages are helpful for communicate with another person verbally. 2 Persons talk the same language; they conversate what they want and it's understandable because of this
      Universal Rules of Languages. If a person talks a different language, but both persons are able to speak other languages, there are 2 keywords: "Bilingual", A person who can talk
      two languages, and "Translation", A person who is trying to change a language to other for communicate with a person who talks another language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site will use common words for understand people to understand in more detaill how to make an Artificial language. The examples will not use Inclusive Languages words
      because that words ruins the real meaning and contains words that are not officially in every language and legal dictionary.
    </p>
    <div class="Pronouns">
      <h1>Pronouns</h1>
      <p>
        The pronouns are words that the meaning is refer or talk to a person or a group. So, if there's a sentence that says: "I be a good website designer", it means that the
        principal person had a smart way to design an entire site web. This words are obviously easy if you want to mean a person or a group. There are subgroups of the pronouns
        that have another proposite and syntaxis than others. So let me start by the most simple details.
        I will show a table using English and the meaning and there is the following table:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Pronouns</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I</td>
          <td>Primary person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>You</td>
          <td>Secondary person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>He</td>
          <td>Third male person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>She</td>
          <td>Third female person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>It</td>
          <td>Third object or thing.</td>
        <tr>
          <td>We</td>
          <td>Primary group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>You</td>
          <td>Secondary group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>They</td>
          <td>Third group.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        This pronouns are used for tell that this person or group did an action. Some languages needs gender for specify more on detaill about of this person, but other languages
        don't care about gender for make it more simple and easy for learn. Like in this case on english: [He, She] are for mean a third person, but this words use the genders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next pronouns are for tell in my imagination, to tell what a person want to do with another person with pronouns. This subset will be called: "Objective Pronouns". An
        example of this objective pronouns are: "Lets make a gift to him", "I love you" and "Among us". This objective pronouns is commonly used at the end of every sentence. I will
        use the same table for know about this subset, but this I will put the Second person and group as only one: "You". There is the table:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Objective Pronouns</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Can someone put a better meaning of the following list? -->
        <!-- IDK if this is not the correct meaning or it can be confusing -->
        <!-- Make a pull request for me, so I will verify if this looks 100% more english -->
        <tr>
          <td>Me</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a primary person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>You</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a secondary person or group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Him</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a third male person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Her</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a third female person.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>It</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a third object or thing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Us</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a primary group.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Them</td>
          <td>Pronoun indicating that an action is for a third group.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        So at the final, we have 2 subsets for the pronouns: The natural pronouns, and the objective pronouns.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Articles">
      <h1>Articles</h1>
      <p>
        The articles are words that modify nouns, specifying if some topic, conversation or something is known or unknown. Lets use all the articles with the Yellow color. 
        There are 3 Articles, showed on a table, but this will be short because there are just three articles. There's the preview:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Article</th>
          <th>Knowledge</th>
          <th>Use</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The</td>
          <td>Known</td>
          <td>All</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>A</td>
          <td>Unknown</td>
          <td>Next noun starts with a Consonant</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>An</td>
          <td>Unknown</td>
          <td>Next noun starts with a Vocal</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        It looks too easy for you and everyone knows about the articles, but is more used because in the majority of words. An example using the articles are too easy and maybe can
        not be relevant, but ok; there are the real examples: "The Uranium is radioactive", "A building is made with bricks" and "An ad is for advertise a product". You see that in
        this examples there is one that was repeated twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Articles can work differently on different languages and sometimes don't include it. In the case of the Spanish works differently. Instead of using the knowledge, in spanish
        you also need to specify the cantity and the gender. 3 words for Article on english, but 8 words for Article on spanish. The example using table on spanish is:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Artículo</th>
          <th>Conocimiento</th>
          <th>Uso</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>El</td>
          <td>Conocido - Known (The)</td>
          <td>Singular y Masculino (and Male)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>La</td>
          <td>Conocido - Known (The)</td>
          <td>Singular y Femenino (and Female)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Los</td>
          <td>Conocido - Known (The)</td>
          <td>Plural y Masculino (and Male)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Las</td>
          <td>Conocido - Known (The)</td>
          <td>Plural y Femenino (and Female)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Un</td>
          <td>Desconocido - Unknown (A, An)</td>
          <td>Singular y Masculino (and Male)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Una</td>
          <td>Desconocido - Unknown (A, An)</td>
          <td>Singular y Femenino (and Female)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Unos</td>
          <td>Desconocido - Unknown (A, An)</td>
          <td>Plural y Masculino (and Male)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Unas</td>
          <td>Desconocido - Unknown (A, An)</td>
          <td>Singular y Femenino (and Female)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Use the articles on spanish gets a little tricky in this moment because you need to use 4*2 that is equals to 8 Spanish articles, when on english is just 2+1 that are 3
        English articles. In the case of chinese, there are not used. So if you say: "The apple" or "An apple", in chinese is simply: Simp("苹果") Trad("蘋果"). In some cases
        for an unknown article is used: Simp("一个") Trad("一個") and it's an optional use.
      </p>
      <p>
        For summarize, articles are helpful for talk about known or unknown topics and this can be different or optional in different languages.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Verbs">
      <h1>Verbs</h1>
      <p>
        Are words that means an action and this words can be a little modified depending if it's used or not. An example of verbs are: "to run", "to eat", "to sript", "to work"
        and "to learn". With this words we can make an sentence for know what a person or object did make. The verbs can be affected depending on the time; only if it mentions
        a person or thing. I will make an table of how this can affect the verbs depending on the time, but I will use the suffixes only. Example:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Suffix</th>
          <th>3 examples</th>
          <th>Time</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-ed</td>
          <td>Created, Worked, Tested</td>
          <td>Past</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-ing</td>
          <td>Creating, Working, Testing</td>
          <td>Present</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>will ...</td>
          <td>Will create, Will work, Will test</td>
          <td>Future</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        In english, it doesn't exist a future suffix for the future verbs. So the future actions for a sentence is always putting the word: "will" before the verb, so in the english
        will mean that this action or sentence will be released in a future.
      </p>
      <p>
        For unpersonal verbs, I will use for example the brittish english; the unpersonal verbs that are used for learn verbs for kids will always have the word: "to" before the verb.
        Example: Using the 3 verbs on a unpersonal dictionary will be: "to create", "to work" and "to test".
      </p>
      <p>
        The verbs are very important on all languages for it's helpful function. This is important for tell someone which action did make the person, for example: "He did eat this
        banana" so we know which action is releasing the third male person. The cantity of verbs are too much that put all the verbs on this site can be very exagerated that it will
        make it more and more heavy. So that's all of the verbs.
