    <h1 class="first_h1">Universal Rules of Languages</h1>
    <p>
      All languages has different types of write words. This types of writting are:<br>
      Alphabetic; Each thing is named in a sequence of characters who each character is pronounced 1 by 1, it means, one consonant for one character, and one vocal for one character. <br>
      Syllabic; Each thing is named in a sequence of characters who each character is pronounced a syllable. one consonant and a vocal (In this order: C + V) for one character <br>
      and Lolographic; Each thing is named and symbolized by a unique character. This one is harder because is one thing, meaning or object for one symbol, or even can be 2 or 3 for
      make the meaning more formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of an alphabetic scripture is the Latin, Cyrillic and the Greek. For the syllabic scripture is the Devanagari (Bharat scripture), Japanese and the majority of southeast
      asian languages, and for the lolographc scripture are the CJK Ideographic; this 3 are: Chinese characters, Kanji Japanese characters and the Hanga Korean characters (actually
      unused).
    </p>
    <p>
      All languages has different words for name a thing. Not all times a language cannot name a thing by the same way. Groups of languages who names a thing and those results looks
      similar, are called, Family languages. A easy example of a family language is the Romance or Latin languages: [Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French and Italian].

    <p>
      Languages are helpful for communicate with another person verbally. 2 Persons talk the same language; they conversate what they want and it's understandable because of this
      Universal Rules of Languages. If a person talks a different language, but both persons are able to speak other languages, there are 2 keywords: "Bilingual", A person who can talk
      two languages, and "Translation", A person who is trying to change a language to other for communicate with a person who talks another language.

    <div class="Pronouns">
      <h1>Pronouns</h1>
      <p>
        The pronouns are words that the meaning is refer or talk to a person or a group. So, if there's a sentence that says: "I be a good website designer", it means that the
        principal person had a smart way to design an entire site web. This words are obviously easy if you want to mean a person or a group. There are subgroups of the pronouns
        that have another proposite and syntaxis than others. So let me start by the most simple details.
        I will show a table using English and the meaning and there is the following table:
        <!-- I soon make it, because I will add a CSS code for "Pronouns" class. -->
